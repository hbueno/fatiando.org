My first paper, 
"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/geo2011-0388.1"&gt;Robust 3D gravity gradient inversion by planting anomalous densities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;",
was finally published in the journal 
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://library.seg.org/geophysics"&gt;Geophysics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;! 
There is a copy available in my 
&lt;a href="/blog/first-publication/www.mendeley.com/profiles/leonardo-uieda/"&gt;Mendeley profile&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was an arduous review, with a complete rewrite of the methodology and 
source code, but it was well worth it. 
The end result looks much better and (in my opinion) is more readable. 
This is the result of my 
Master's dissertation at the 
&lt;a href="http://www.on.br/"&gt;Observat&amp;#243;rio Nacional&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil, 
where I'm currently doing my PhD. 
The title may sound funny (even for geophysicists) and that is a good thing 
because it was our intention! 
It is a pun on the method because we use elements called "seeds" 
(this one is 
&lt;a href="http://link.aip.org/link/?GPY/51/988/1&amp;amp;Agg=doi"&gt;not by us&lt;/a&gt;) 
that grow into the final solution (an anomalous density).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Go see &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.91469"&gt;an animation of 
the inversion process&lt;/a&gt; on 
&lt;a href="http://www.figshare.com/"&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt; 
because it explains the idea of the method much better than words!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This paper is about a method that 
&lt;a href="http://fatiando.org/people/uieda/"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href="http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?metodo=apresentar&amp;amp;id=K4793243Y4"&gt;my supervisor&lt;/a&gt; 
developed for 3D &lt;em&gt;geophysical inversion&lt;/em&gt;. 
Geophysical inversion is basically an estimation problem. 
We try to estimate the physical properties (density, shape, etc) 
of a geologic structure based on measured data 
(like the gravity field perturbation of the structure). 
This is problematic because it is an 
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-posed_problem"&gt;ill-posed problem&lt;/a&gt;, 
which means that there are an infinite number of solutions (non-unique) and, 
if there is a solution, it is unstable (very sensitive to noise in the data). 
The good about this is that it keeps me "employed" 
(as much as grad student can be)! 
The trick, then, is introducing more information into the inversion, 
be it geometric, geologic, or merely mathematical. 
So that is what we did, in a heuristic sort of way. 
Plus, we used a smart algorithm to save 
&lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of computation time and memory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As is always the case in methodology research, 
I had to implement the &lt;strong&gt;software&lt;/strong&gt; for doing all this. 
At the time I started this project (around October 2010) 
I was already working on an early version of 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/leouieda/fatiando"&gt;Fatiando a Terra&lt;/a&gt;. 
So naturally, I 
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29"&gt;forked&lt;/a&gt; 
the &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/fatiando/fatiando-dev"&gt;Fatiando repository on Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; 
and started implementing the inversion algorithm as module 
(called &lt;em&gt;harvester&lt;/em&gt;) 
of the &lt;a href="http://fatiando.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/fatiando.html"&gt;fatiando&lt;/a&gt; 
package. 
The good thing about this is that every time I need some functionality, 
I would go and implement it on Fatiando and pull the changes back. 
So the Fatiando project grew a lot during this time 
and became much more useful. 
I also saw a lot of design flaws, 
which I later resolved, when I was making the scripts to obtain the 
results in the paper. 
Now that the paper is out, 
I've merged the changes back into Fatiando and they will 
be &lt;strong&gt;out soon in the v0.1 release&lt;/strong&gt;! 
There is also a &lt;strong&gt;command line program&lt;/strong&gt; 
that runs the inversion, 
if you don't want to get your hands dirty with 
&lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; scripts. 
If you're curious, you can check out the 
&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/fatiando/fatiando-dev/src"&gt;development source&lt;/a&gt; 
and  also browse the 
&lt;a href="http://fatiando.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/gravmag.harvester.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During the writing process, 
we had a lot of complaints that the paper was too big 
(it really was). 
So I decided to finally start using 
&lt;a href="http://www.figshare.com/"&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt; and 
uploaded the figures and sections that I had to remove as 
&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.91574"&gt;supplementary material&lt;/a&gt; 
and also an 
&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.91469"&gt;animation&lt;/a&gt;! 
There is also a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.91511"&gt;poster&lt;/a&gt; 
there that about this that I presented at the 
&lt;a href="http://www.eage.org/events/index.php?eventid=408"&gt;2011 EAGE meeting&lt;/a&gt; 
in Vienna. 
So many thanks to the figshare team 
(specially &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/113271696737383211339"&gt;Mark Hahnel&lt;/a&gt;) 
for providing this great service that certainly made this paper better!
&lt;/p&gt;
